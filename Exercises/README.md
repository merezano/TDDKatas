# Practicing Test-Driven Development

## Instructions
The purpose of these exercises is to provide an experience of what it feels like to guide software construction by tests. 

A process model you could follow is:
1. Define a common test fixture (e.g., objects with specific test data) that you will likely need for most of the test cases.

2. Write a new test case 
..a. Make sure the test case name reveals the scenario being tested and the expected behavior
..b. Make sure the test case structure exercises the SUT, and verifies the results.
..c. Some generic assertions you might need includes: `assertEquals, assertNull, assertNotNull, assertTrue, assertFalse, and expected = <exception>`.

3. Write the code that would make the pass pass. 

4. Go back to step 2. Keep following this cycle until you feel you would have reached an appropriate implementation.

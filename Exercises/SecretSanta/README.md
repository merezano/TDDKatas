# Secret Santa
_Secret Santa_ is a Western Christmas tradition in which members of a group or community (e.g., family, co-workers) are assigned a person to whom they anonymously give a gift; thus **Secret** Santa.

A common procedure for assigning the secret santas is to place the names of the participants in a hat, and have the participants to draw the name of a person for whom to buy a gift. If someone draws his/her own name, that name is returned to the hat and another draw is made.

The requirement is to write a method that would automate the Secret Santa drawing names process. 
For this implementation assume that a routine will consume some sort of a list of names and will produce some sort of a structure that pairs the names appropriately.

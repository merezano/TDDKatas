# Maximum Subsequence Sum
This method should find the subsequence within a list of integer values which has the largest sum.

## Examples
- For the sequence of values `−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4`; the subsequence with the largest sum is 
  `4, −1, 2, 1`, which sum is `6`.  
- For the sequence of values `1, 2, -1, 2`; the subsequence with the largest sum is the entire list, which sum is `4`. 
- For an empty list, the maximum subsequence sum is `0`.

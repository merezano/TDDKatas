# Maximum Subsequence Sum
This method should find the subsequence within a list of integer values which has the largest sum.

## Examples
- for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the subsequence with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, which sum is 6.  
- For the sequence of values 1, 2, -1, 2; the subsequence with the largest sum is the entire list, which sum is 4. 
- For an empty list the maximum subsequence sum is 0.
